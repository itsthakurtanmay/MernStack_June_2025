//In this lecture we will study about string methods;


//different way of printing string;

let str1 = "hello evryone"; //method 1 : using double quotes;
let str2 = 'I am fine'; //method 2 : using single quotes;
let str3 = `i am very good boy`; //method 3 : using backticks;

console.log(str1,str2,str3);


//Note : Method 3 is now popular and mostly used cauz if we want to show data that is coming from backend then this approach is much more feasible 

//Example : 
let tomatoPrice = 50;
console.log(`Today's tomato price is : ${tomatoPrice}`);


//In future if i update the price of tomatoPrice from backend then it will automatically shown on frontend without any changes;

//Yes,we have another approach as well;
